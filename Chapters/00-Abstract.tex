\chapter*{Abstract}
\label{ch:abstract}

The present guide provides a pragmatic and practical explanation for students in "代培" programs at the University of Science and Technology of China. It is meant to summarise the typical steps and resources needed to begin a postgraduate programme with a specific focus on administrative responsibilities, schooling, and cultural adaptation. The main objective is to reduce friction and provide a quick start so that students can focus on research faster.
